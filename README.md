# Rover Map Generator

Randomly generates maps for Assignment 1, CSCI 561 and solves them.

## How does it work?

The auspices of `numpy.random` and PNG libraries

## How do I make it work?

* Clone the repository
* Install the required dependencies `numpy` `Pillow` `pypng`
* Run `testcasegen.py` and follow the instructions
* `input_gen` is the appropriate input file.

## I want MOAR test cases

This will automate the entire stack, including execution and require some work from your end. Do the following:

* Interface your work so that it works with `tcgen.py` and `executeAlgorithm` works. Please remember not to use your original homework file for this. You will be making (almost) irreversible changes that will bite you in the end.
* Run `tcgen.py` and follow the instructions.
* Grab a coffee or go for a walk.

## Can I use this for my assignment

Absolutely not.
